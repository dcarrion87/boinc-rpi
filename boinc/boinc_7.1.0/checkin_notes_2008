    - web: My Account page, other user account page, and profile pages

        This accomplishes two things:
        1) it puts community info in more places;
        2) it provides a reasonable way to format long lists of friends;
            they just continue down the right column.

    - Client: add <run_apps_manually> config flag.
        This is for debugging apps (currently works only in Unix).
        What it does: when running an app,
        the client does everything except actually fork/exec the app,
        i.e. it sets up the slot dir, creates shared mem segment etc.
        It then continues as if the app were actually running,
        and you can then manually run your app under a debugger
        in the slot directory.
        Note: the client won't notice the termination of your app.
    - API, Unix: in situations where the timer thread wants to exit
        (e.g. it notices a missing heartbeat).
        don't directly call boinc_exit(),
        since this touches data structures that the worker thread
        may be using concurrently.
        Instead, set a flag telling the worker thread to call boinc_exit()
        (which it will do from its signal handler)
        This is an attempt to fix problems reported by Bernd;
        I haven't tested it.

        It didn't work on a host's first scheduler RPC

        How do we look up user in this case?
        The weak auth is not stored explicitly in the DB.

    - client: a project (Ralph) had accidentally included a .svn directory in a zip archive,
        resulting in a lot of read-only files in its slot directories.
        When the client attempts to delete these files,
        each delete fails and the client retries for about 5 seconds.
        This adds up to a delay of about 20 minutes,
        during which the client (and Manager) appear to be hung.

        Solution:
        1) if a file delete fails with error ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED,
            use SetFileAttributes() to clear the read-only flag, then try again.
        2) Don't use the 5-second retry mechanism when clearing out
            slot directories.  These can contain unbounded numbers of files,
            and this can lead to long periods where the client appears hung.

    - web: fixed screwed-up UOTD logic.
        The meaning of the <screen_profiles> config flag is:
        If set:
            profiles must be screened by admins before their photo is shown.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
            (and they become eligible to be UOTD)
        If not set:
            profile photos are always shown.
            Profiles must be screened by admins before
            they are eligible for UOTD.
            When this is done, profile.verification is set to 1
        So default_uotd_candidates_query() is the same in either case.

        Hopefully this will fix a race condition
        where WU results get sent to different HR classes.
        (Alternatively we could use transactions,
        or acquire the semaphore during read/update,
        but this could impact performance).

    - MGR: Allow multiple selections in Transfers grid view only 
        (requested by Jorden van der Elst).  The Transfers tab is 
        the only grid view where the buttons did work properly with 
        multiple selections, so there is no reason to disable it.
        The other tabs disabled all buttons when multiple items were 
        selected, so allowing multiple selections was confusing to 
        users.
    - MGR: When order of rows in grid views changes (due to sorting or 
        changes in data), reselect the same data in the rearranged rows
        using:
            Projects tab: project name only
            Tasks tab: project name and work unit (task) name
            Transfers tab: project name and file name
            Messages tab: sequence number only.
    - MGR: set m_bForceUpdateSelection=true when deleting rows from grid 
        views.  Fixes bug: if the last row was selected and is deleted, 
        the new last row is automatically selected but the buttons were 
        not updated to reflect the new selection.

    - MGR: Fully implement support for multiple selections in Tasks 
        and Projects grid views.  Handles conflicts as follows:
          - Disables buttons which change functions (Suspend / Resume, 
            No New Tasks / Allow New Tasks) if user selects a mix of 
            items inconsistent with either function.  
          - Disables any buttons (Show Graphics, Abort) which would be 
            disabled for any one of the selected items.
          - Disables and hides project web site buttons if items from 
            more than one project are selected.
          - For operations which require confirmation (Abort, Reset,
            Detach) asks in a separate dialog for each selected item. 
            User can answer NO to some and YES to others and it will 
            perform the operation only on those with a YES response.
        - Added two defines: PREVENT_MULTIPLE_TASK_SELECTIONS and 
            PREVENT_MULTIPLE_PROJECT_SELECTIONS in the corresponding 
            header files.  Both are currently defined false.  Define 
            these as true to restrict that tab to single-selections.

    Various changes from Kevin Reed/WCG:
    - server: add workunit.rsc_bandwidth_bound: if nonzero,
        send this WU only to hosts with that much download bandwidth
    - assimilators: if a handler returns DEFER_ASSIMILATION,
        the WU remains in INIT state and will be handled when the
        next instance completes.
        Useful if you want the assimilator to see all instances.
    - scheduler: when setting result.outcome = DETACHED,
        set received_time to now
    - scheduler: removed the reliable_time and reliable_min_avg_credit
        options
    - scheduler/web: add optional <allow_non_preferred_projects>
        in project preferences.
        If present, user will accept work from non-selected apps
        if no work is available for selected apps
    - scheduler: improved messages for projects with multiple apps
    - scheduler: added config options
        <granted_credit_weight> and <granted_credit_ramp_up>.
        Used in calculating host.claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        but I'm not sure how.

        The new field (workunit.rsc_bandwidth_bound)
        goes at the END of the record.
        Always do it this way!
    - make_work: after creating a batch of new WUs,
        we were waiting 60 sec for the transitioner to
        create the results for them
        (so that our next count of unsent results would be correct).
        This is bogus; if e.g. the transitioner isn't running,
        we'll never get the results, and we'll keep creating WUs forever.

        Instead: explicitly wait for there to be results for
        the last WU from the batch just created.

    Various preparation for handling multithreaded apps
    and apps that use coprocessors.
    There now can be several app_versions for the same
    (app, platform, version_num) combination.
    This changes a number of things.

    - Added app_version.plan_class field to DB
    - update_versions now looks for a :plan-class in the
        file or directory name, and puts it in the app_version's DB record
    - Change uniqueness constraint to include plan_class
    - Feeder: the feeder was putting non-deprecated app_versions
        in shared mem, and leaving it to the scheduler to
        find the latest version for a given platform.
        This is dumb.
        Instead, for each app/platform pair the feeder now
        finds the highest version number of a non-deprecated app version,
        and enumerates all non-deprecated app_versions with that
        app/platform/version
    - Scheduler: add a BEST_APP_VERSION data structure that keeps track,
        for each app, what the best app_version is for this host.
        This saves the work of recomputing it for each job.

        under OS 10.5 or later, continue to use older code on earlier 
        systems without these APIs.
    - Mac: Change back to saving unstripped Client and Manager executables for 
        symbol tables rather than separate .dSYM files, which cannot be loaded 
        by atos command-line utility.  This also lets user substitute the 
        unstripped executable into application bundle to get backtraces with 
        symbols when debugging a crash in the field.  Set visibility of all 
        variables in Client and Manager to not be hidden so they appear in

    - client (Unix): use symbolic links instead of XML link files.
        This will allow applications to access shared libraries
        by their logical names,
        which simplifies things when you have multiple platforms,
        and the apps (or libraries) refer to shared libraries
        by names that don't include the platform.
        This shouldn't impact the API - boinc_resolve_filename()
        will open the file, see that it's not an XML link file,
        and the symbolic link will be used directly.
        At some point we can change boinc_resolve_filename() on Unix
        to be a no-op if the client is 6.2+
    - client (Unix):
        Append the slot dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    - update_versions: added a feature where you can put a file
        "extra_xml" in the app dir, and it will get included in
        the app versions's xml_doc.

    - Client: fix  a compiler warning which indicated a real logic error
        (variable used uninitialized).
    - Mac: More work on backtrace code: run atos utility via a bidirectional
        pipe instead of backtrace_symbols_fd() API to get better symbols
        in backtrace.  
        Set visibility of all variables in Client and Manager back to hidden
        (as before) to reduce size of executables,
        since atos utility can use hidden symbols.
        This also involves return to previous wxWidgets build script.

Charlie Mar 21 2008
    - Mac: More sandbox security changes for symlinks: lchown is not available 
        under OS 10.3.9, so don't use it.  The system ignores ownership and 
        permissions of symbolic links, so setprojectgrp does nothing if it is  
        called for a symbolic link.  
        Also make additional changes to check_security and SetupSecurity.

    Changes for multithread app support:

    - update_versions: use __ (not :) as separator for plan class
    - client: add plan_class to APP_VERSION;
        an app version is now identified by platform/version/plan_class
    - client CPU scheduler: don't assume apps use 1 CPU
    - client: add avg_ncpus, max_cpus, flops, cmdline to RESULT
    - scheduler: implement app planning scheme

    Other changes:

    - client: if symlink() fails, make a XML soft link instead
        (for Unix running off a FAT32 FS)
    - client: don't accept nonpositive resource share from AMS
    - daemons and DB: check for error returns from enumerations,
        and exit if so.  Thus, if the MySQL server goes down,
        all the daemons will soon exit.
        The cron script will restart them every 5 min,
        so when the DB server comes back up so will the project.
    - web: show empty max CPU % as ---
    - API: get rid of all_threads_cpu_time option (always the case now)

    - server and client:
        in server->client reply messages and in the client itself,
        move app-planning info from RESULT to APP_VERSION.
        This was necessary to allow anonymous platform info (app_info.xml)
        to specify avg_ncpus, etc.
        e.g., if someone wants to write a multithread version of SETI@home,
        or a GPU/CUDA version,
        they can run it using the anonymous platform mechanism
        and it will be scheduled correctly.

        If a server sends an existing APP_VERSION but with different
        app-planning info, the client will accept and use the new info.

    - Build fixes for non-Win32, non-Linux, non-MacOS systems.
    - configure script: 
        - Added checks for functions strdup(), strdupa(), 
            daemon(), stat64(), strcasestr()
        - Fixed problems with kc_mysql.m4 and wxWidgets.m4 returning
        invalid CFLAGS and LIBS flags.
    - Fixed incorrect order of pthread flag checking on solaris.
    - New files: lib/unix_util.[Ch].  Currently contains implementation of
        daemon() for systems that lack it.
    - Access to binary files in /proc was failing on some systems when compiled
        with 64 bit file access.  Rearranged headers and defines to force 32bit
        file access in hostinfo_unix.C
    - all_tty_idle() didn't work as advertised on any system as far as I can
        tell.  I rewrote it to check ttys that are not named /dev/tty[1-9].
        The old implementation was modifying a statically allocated read-only
        string, anyway.
    - added implementation of non-standard function strcasestr() to str_util.C
    - added #define of MAP_FILE to shmem.C, because it is missing from most
        unix systems, (and is unnecessary on linux anyway).
    - other minor bug fixes.

    - API: change boinc_resolve_filename() so that it detects symbolic links

        Also, if the virtual file doesn't exist (as in the standalone case)
        just return zero; otherwise if the app is running standalone
        and checks the return value, it will error out.

        NOTE: apps that check the return value of boinc_resolve_filename()
        won't work on 6.12+ under Unix;
        recompiling with this change will fix the problem.

    - Client (Windows) change the way core/app shmem segs are created.
        Old: get_shmem_seg_name() tries names of the form shm_boinc_N
            until it finds one for which creating succeeds.
            Then it detaches (deletes) the segment and records the name.
            Later, the segment is created again.
            This creates a race condition if two core clients
            are running on the same host.
            It's also kind of silly.
        New: get_shmem_seg_name() doesn't detach the segment,
            and we dont have to create it again later.

    - scheduler: there were several situations where the scheduler
        would send a reply without having looked up the user and team
        in the DB; e.g.:
        - client version# is too low
        - DB is down
        - host is blacklisted
        It would then send a full scheduler reply,
        including a blank team name and other missing info.
        
        Fix this by setting reply.nucleus_only initially
        (this causes a minimal reply to be sent)
        and clearing it only if the host/user/team lookup succeeds.

    - WINSETUP: Fix a struct alignment issue when dumping the base64 encoded
        password for boinc_project to a file.
        
        ATL's string conversion functions act of a class and not a buffer
        which makes memory management easier but doesn't interop well with
        fprintf unless you specify the buffer name directly.

    - web: clean up stuff related to stripslashes():
        1) it's not correct to apply stripslashes() to all form input.
            That should be done only if magic quotes is on.
            I fixed this by adding a function undo_magic_quotes()
            that does the right thing.
        2) There's no reason to strip backslashes from user-supplied text
            (forum titles and bodies, private messages, passwords etc.)
            I'm not sure why this was being done.
            It prevented messages from containing backslashes.

    - web: cleaned up logic of string processing.
        There are two aspects:
        1) undoing magic quotes (if it's being used).
            This must be done for all GET and POST string inputs.
            It is now done automatically by get_str() and post_str().
            The places that refer to $_GET and $_POST directly
            must do it themselves using undo_magic_quotes().
        2) Escaping user-supplied strings before using them in DB queries.
            This is done by process_user_text()
            (which should be renamed db_escape_string()).
            The new principle:
            call process_user_text() in the function that does the DB query
            (not at any higher level).

        follow a link, then click Back,
        you'll go back the original scroll position rather than top of page.

        These pointers become dangling when the project is detached.
        It's not sufficient to do schedule_cpus() because this returns

    -MGR: Add all features of Grid Views to Accessible Views Projects Tab, 
        Tasks Tab and Tranfers Tab, including: progress bars, light gray 
        stripes on alternate rows, sorting, multiple selections.  
        For those fields where it is practical to do so, store data in native  
        form for better efficiency comparing, sorting and updating cached  
        data;format data only when needed for list display.  Add a separate 
        array of integers which are indexes into the list; sort only this 
        array to make sorting faster & more efficient, and to maintain 
        associations with underlying data after sorting (view's data struct 
        at index X always corresponds to result at index X).
        Refresh only those rows with changed values or which have moved due to 
        sorting.  Restore previous sorting settings when relaunching Manager.

        rather than boinc/apps/upper_case.
        (boinc_samples must be installed in the same dir as boinc).

        The reason: the BOINC autoconf-based build process
        produces executables that have zillions of shared library dependencies,
        and generally won't run on machines other than
        the one where they were built.
        Executables built in boinc_samples/ don't have this problem.

    - server code: at some point I made a global var "SCHED_CONFIG config",
        mostly so that the parse function could assume
        that everything was initially zero.
        However, various back-end functions pass around SCHED_CONFIG&
        as an argument (also named "config").
        This creates a shadow, which is always bad.
        Worse is the possibility that some projects have back-end programs
        that have a SCHED_CONFIG variable that's automatic,
        and therefore isn't zero initially,
        and therefore isn't parsing correctly.

        To fix this, I changed the 2 vectors in SCHED_CONFIG into pointers,
        and have the parse routine zero the structure.
        I was tempted to remove the SCHED_CONFIG& args to back-end functions,
        but this would have broken some projects' code.
        I did, however, change the name from config to config_loc
        to avoid shadowing.

        Also fixed various other compiler warnings.

    - client and server: the client includes global_prefs.xml
        in scheduler request messages, without checking its contents.
        One user had apparently edited global_prefs.xml with an XML editor;
        it had an <?xml tag at the start,
        and had been collapsed into a single line with no newlines,
        and no newline at the end.
        This caused all scheduler requests from that client to get
        "Incomplete request" responses.

        The long-term fix is for the client to verify global_prefs.xml,
        and for the scheduler to parse it with XML_PARSER.
        As a short-term fix, I made these changes:
        - If the scheduler reads a line that's too long, it ignores it.
        - The scheduler ignores <?xml

    - WINSETUP: Instead of calling the Windows API to determinethe various
        special folders, use the MSI properties which match the 'choose folder'
        dialog. We can skip the step if doing a case insensitive compare.
        Plus it appears that MSI normalizes the paths for us.

    - scheduler: Add a notion of "hard app" for SETI@home.
        If an app is hard, the scheduler always does the deadline check,
        even if the client has no other jobs for this project.
        And the estimated wallclock duration is multiplied by 1.3,
        to avoid sending jobs to hosts that will barely make the deadline.

        Hard apps are marked by setting weight = -1.
        This is a total kludge, to avoid adding another field to app.

        is stuck in wxWidget code or not, but the installer shouldn't
        ever get stuck waiting on a hung app.

    - Implementation of automatic credit leveling for cpu based projects that
      wish to use it.
    - The script calculate_credit_multiplier (expected to be run daily as
      a config.xml task) looks at the ratio of granted credit to CPU time 
      for recent results for each app.  Multiplier is calculated to cause 
      median hosts granted credit per cpu second to equal to equal that 
      expected from its benchmarks.  This is 30-day exponentially averaged 
      with the previous value of the multplier and stored in the table 
      credit_multplier.
    - When a result is received the server adjusts claimed credit by the
      value the multiplier had when the result was sent.

    - CLIENT/MGR/TRAY: When installed on Vista and UAC is turned on
        the user by default cannot create globally shared objects. This
        becomes a problem when protected application mode is turned off
        for keyboard and mouse detection.  Basically all of the components
        would start up and fail to create the shared memory segment
        and report the error through stderr which most people don't look
        at by default.
        
        The client is now the only component that is allowed to create the
        shared memory segment, if creating the global segment fails it'll
        create a local one instead. Both the tray and manager now just attach
        to the existing segment, first trying the global one then the local
        one.

          - Demand RPCs are run one at a time and don't return to requesting 
            call until each RPC is completed.

        hidden / minimized.

        Old: when checking whether an app can be run,
            check for sufficient coprocessors relative to
            the current coprocessor usage.
            Bug: it there are 2 CUDA jobs,
            the scheduler will decide to run both.
            enforce_scheduler() will only be able to run one,
            and the other CPU will be idle.
        New: include coprocessor usage (along with RAM and CPUs)
            in the check, and do a simulated reservation.
            In the above scenario, the scheduler will select
            one CUDA app and one non-CUDA app.

    - win_build: Finally figured out what the problem was with how I

        automaticaaly specifies the stdafx.cpp as the source file that
        is supposed to create the pre-compiled header for auto generated
        project files.  The project is just configured to use a pre-compiled
        header.  All I had done in the past was enable pre-compiled
        headers, but didn't create a stub cpp file to create the pre-compiled
        header with.  Now all the client projects are configured to use
        pre-compiled headers.  BOINC now compiles in 20 seconds. BOINC Manager
        in a minute. Everything else builds in 5 seconds or less.

    - Fixed fcgi builds to use an installed version of fcgi_stdio.h rather than
      a modified boinc version.
    - Added new header "boinc_fcgi.h" to be used instead of "fcgi_stdio.h".
      This header defines I/O functions in the namespace FCGI rather than using
      redefined functions the way "fcgi_stdio.h" does.  This was causing a lot
      of headaches when both <cstdio> and "fcgi_stdio.h" was called.  Using
      overloaded functions fixes this problem, except when the only difference
      between functions is the return type (for example ::fopen() returns FILE*
      and FCGI::fopen() returns FCGI_FILE*).

    - client: clarify and fix the semantics of "next RPC time".
        Here's are the new semantics: a scheduler reply can include
        <next_rpc_delay>
            Make another RPC ASAP after this amount of time elapses.
            This is specified by the <next_rpc_delay> element in config.xml.
        <request_delay>
            Don't make another RPC until this amount of time elapses.
            This is sent automatically (and sometimes with large delays)
            by various parts of the scheduler.
        next_rpc_delay now "overrides" request_delay in the sense that
        request_delay is ignored if it's greater than next_rpc_delay.

        In addition: the client maintains a min_rpc_time which is set based
        on request_delay and also by various exponential backoff schemes.
        new_rpc_delay now overrides this as well, in the same sense.

        and nanosleep() calls from RPC thread and will hopefully

        This is needed when there are coproc (i.e. CUDA) jobs;
        CPUs may be idle because pending jobs are waiting for active jobs
        to release coprocs.
        In this situation the CPU idleness should not be counted as shortfall;
        otherwise (if there are only coproc jobs) there will always be a shortfall,

    - MGR: Earlier attempts at fixing Task Pane background erase glitch were 
        unsuccessful, and Rom told me this bug has been around for a very 
        long time.  So remove the unsuccessful changes and add new window 
        style wxFULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE to Task Pane as recommended by 
        wxWidgets documentation.  
    - MGR: Remove m_bForceUpdateSelection logic; instead remove call to 
        UpdateSelection() from the only place the force flag was not set, 
        in CBOINCBaseView::OnListRender().

    - client: use FLOPs, rather than CPU time,
