Did you know that you can use your computer
to help University of California scientists
find the first evidence of life outside Earth?
It's called SETI@home.
The program analyzes data from the world's largest radio telescope,
looking for signals from other planets and stars.

<p>
I'm running SETI@home on my computer,
and so are hundreds of thousands of other people
in 240 countries around the world.
The <a href=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu>SETI@home web site</a>
lets you meet them and exchange messages.

<p>
Running SETI@home is easy.
All you have to do is install a program on your computer;
it takes about 5 minutes, and it's simple and safe.
Just <a href=http://setiathome.berkeley.edu>visit the SETI@home web site</a>.

Thanks, and I hope to see you on SETI@home -
