This directory tree is used for files required to create a distribution
package for various operating systems.  The tree structure is as follows...

packages/{OS name}/{Package Manager or OS Distribution or Web Site}

Since these directories are maintained by the package maintainers, any
instructions for creating the packages or Makefiles are created the package
maintainers, and may, therefore vary in quality, and may require manual
configuration change.  Because these files are not maintained by the BOINC 
developers, we don't guarantee they will work.  Any bug reports
related to files in this tree will probably be given low priority.
