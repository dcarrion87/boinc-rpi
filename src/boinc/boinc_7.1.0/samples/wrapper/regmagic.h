 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by Benoit
 *** Goudreault-Emond, bge@videotron.ca, on 2002/01/03, to add \< and
 *** \> for word matching, as well as pseudo character classes.  It
 *** also handles wide characters quite well now. Also, the API was
 *** changed so an arbitrary number of parenthesized expressions can
 *** be used (and so were the internals of the regexp engine).
 ***
 *** In general, the new API should be more re-entrant.
