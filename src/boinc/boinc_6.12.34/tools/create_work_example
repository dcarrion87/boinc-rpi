# example of how to create a workunit

# copy the input file from a known place into the download hierarchy
#
cp download/input `bin/dir_hier_path input`

# Run create_work to create the WU.
# The WU name ("wu_nodelete") includes the string "nodelete".
# This causes the file deleter to not delete its input files,
# so that we can use make_work.
