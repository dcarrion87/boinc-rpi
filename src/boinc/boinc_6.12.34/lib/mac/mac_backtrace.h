 *  mac_backtrace.h
 *
 */
 
/* This is a rudimentary backtrace generator for boinc project applications.  
*
* It is adapted from Apple Developer Technical Support Sample Code 
*   MoreisBetter / MoreDebugging / MoreBacktraceTest
*  The symbols it displays are not always clean.  
*
* This code handles Mac OS X 10.3.x through 10.4.2.  It may require some 
* adjustment for future OS versions; see the discussion of _sigtramp and 
* PowerPC Signal Stack Frames below.
*
*  For useful tips on using backtrace information, see Apple Tech Note 2123:
*  http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2123.html#SECNOSYMBOLS
*
*  To convert addresses to correct symbols, use the atos command-line tool:
*  atos -o path/to/executable/with/symbols address
*  Note: if address 1a23 is hex, use 0x1a23.  
*
*  To demangle mangled C++ symbols, use the c++filt command-line tool. 
*  You may need to prefix C++ symbols with an additonal underscore before 
*  passing them to c++filt (so they begin with two underscore characters).
*
*  Flags in backtrace:
*    F this frame pointer is bad
*    P this PC is bad
*    S this frame is a signal handler
*
