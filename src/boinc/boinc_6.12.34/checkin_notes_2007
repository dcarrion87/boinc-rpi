        as computed by Bruce's update_credit_per_cpu_sec() function
        (finally, a use for hyperbolic trig functions in BOINC).
        Prior to this it was the most recent value of
        claimed credit per CPU sec, which is not as useful.
        Add a new non-DB member to HOST, claimed_credit_per_cpu_sec,
        for this purpose.
    - db_dump.C: export host.credit_per_cpu_sec
    - move update_credit_per_cpu_sec() from lib/util.C to sched/validate_util.C

    Once a few projects pick up this change, it will be useful
    for comparing credit-granting policies between projects
    (for hosts that participate in multiple projects,
    the credit per CPU second should be about the same).

    - core client: fix a bug that could cause computation to stop.
        The problem: if we suspended a task by sending it a <quit/> message,
        we were changing its scheduler state to CPU_SCHED_PREEMPTED
        but not changing its task state (PROCESS_EXECUTING).
        If, for some reason, the process didn't exit right away,
        the scheduler would treat it as still running,
        since it builds its "currently running" list based on task_state.
        Solution: the scheduler shouldn't be looking at task_state.
        Use scheduler_state instead.
        It's still a mystery why the app wasn't quitting.

    - core client: there was logic that wouldn't start a result
        for a project if it had > 2 active uploads
        (intended to prevent an unbounded buildup of files
        for a project whose upload server is broken).
        This was never triggered since the default is 2 active
        transfers per project.
        Maybe I meant persistent file transfers.
        In any case, this is a bad policy because there may be
        a project with lots of output files per result, possibly large,
        and there's no reason to keep it from computing.
        So instead, I changed it to not start a result from a project
        if its number of results in FILES_UPLOADING state exceeds 2*ncpus.

    - Support projects that want to specify credit per WU can do so by:
        1) add a <credit>x</credit> element to your WU template,
            or pass an 'additional_xml' argument containing
            <credit>x</credit> to create_work()
            (either the function or the program)
        2) change your validator so that compute_granted_credit()
            calls get_credit_from_wu().
            This parses the <credit> element in the workunit's XML,
            and grants that much credit.
    - Change the simple validator framework so that an
        additional WORKUNIT& is passed to compute_granted_credit().

David  2 Feb 2007
    - core client: fix bug where client thinks an app is running but it isn't.
        Basic problem: there are two layers
        1) process control: start/stop/suspend/resume, handle exits.
            files: app_*.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::task_state
        2) CPU scheduling: decide what should run
            files: cpu_sched.C
            It owns ACTIVE_TASK::scheduler_state.
        These layers weren't cleanly separated;
        e.g. the CPU sched layer relied on the process control layer
        to set scheduler_state in some cases,
        and this wasn't always being done.
        I fixed this; the layers are now separated.
        Also: added new task_state value, PROCESS_QUIT_PENDING

    - core client: when a scheduler reply has a FILE_INFO for a

         overwrite the file_signature field only if the
         new record actually has one.

         This fixes a bug where a project used the same file in
         both an APP_VERSION and a WORKUNIT.
         The scheduler reply contained two <file_info> elements for the file;
         the first had a signature, the second didn't.
         The second one overwrote the first,
         and the app version was rejected because one its file wasn't signed.

    - scheduler: stop logging error messages about unrecognized
      <no_forum_rating> tag.
    - locality scheduler: when getting a working set file name
      using glob(3), do not glob multiple times, possibly getting
      back the same file name again.  Instead glob once and then
      randomly choose file names, crossing items off the list one
      at a time. Note: I wrote this code using STL vectors and
      strings, but now regret this: the necessary vector insertions
      are potentially inefficient..  Sometime next week I will 
      recode this using a C-style pointer arrays with guaranteed O(1)
      efficiency.  But I want to get this into CVS while it's
      working.

    SANDBOX: only the super-user can send signal to another user's process. 
        Core client runs as user boinc_master, but project applications run 
        as user boinc_project, so ACTIVE_TASK::kill_task() probably could not
        work as written.  I added code which uses switcher helper application 
        to kill the tasks, but also left in the direct kill call just to be 
        safe.
    Note: CBOINCGUIApp::ShutdownBOINCCore() probably has this same problem, 
        but this kill() is only used in extraordinary circumstances. 
     Mac: The Mac screensaver launches the core client if not already running.
        In this case, it used to kill the cc when screensaver was dismissed.
        But Mac OS X dismisses screensavers when energy saver puts displays 
        to sleep, so we want cc to then continue running.  New code launches 
        cc with -saver argument, lets cc run when saver quits.  New logic in 
        cc quits if (launched by screensaver) and (recent user activity) and 
        (parent [screensaver] has exited).  This takes into account that if 
        user invoked screensaver by moving mouse into "hot corner" there will 
        be recent user activity.  Added logic to screensaver to relaunch cc in 
        case of certain race conditions (e.g., screensaver started, dismissed, 
        restarted in rapid succession.)
    - Mac Manager: add -launched_by_manager arg when launching core client.

    A bunch of security-related changes:
    - Most functions that return paths now take an additional
        "length" parameter to prevent buffer overrun if the
        project URL or filename is extremely long.
    - Use snprintf() and vsnprintf() in a bunch of places
        to avoid buffer overrun.
    - Core client: Add suppress_net_info config flag
        (don't send IP address and domain name to servers)
    - Core client: Add disallow_attach config file
        (don't allow attach to new projects)
    - Core client: Add os_random_only config flag.
        (exit if OS-level random string functions fail
        when generating GUI RPC password)
    - Core client: if a filename (in <FILE_INFO>s from server)
        contains directory traversal chars (..),
        or format conversion chars (%),
        or is empty,
        reject it.

    Other changes:
    - Core client: change size of path buffers from 256 to 1024.
        Should make this a #define at some point.
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLISTENTRY -> PROJECT_LIST_ENTRY
        (let's stick with BOINC coding standards)
    - GUI RPC: rename PROJECTLIST -> ALL_PROJECTS_LIST
        (let's not confuse currently attached projects with all projects)
    - GUI RPC: make get_all_projects_list() into an actual RPC,
        not just reading a file (which won't exist in the RPC client's
        current dir, e.g. if it's remote).
    - GUI RPC: rename desc -> description and img -> image
        in project list XML exported by BOINC server.
        Let's NEVER have different spelling between
        XML tabs and structure fields!!
    - GUI RPC: Include rr_sim_deadlines_missed in PROJECT

            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use.
            When the app starts, try to clean out the slot dir.
            If can't clean it out, rename it (to DELETE_ME_*)
            and create another dir.
            On startup, delete dirs named DELETE_ME_*
            The problem: if you can't clean out a dir (on Windows)
            you're not going to be able to rename it.
            So the app will start in a non-empty dir.
        New:
            assign new ACTIVE_TASK the lowest slot number not in use
            and for which an empty directory can be created.
            On start, delete dirs and files not in use by an active task.
    - core client: fix bug where clean_out_dir() could return zero
        even though the dir isn't emptied.

    - MGR: Fix variuos performance problems with the Grid based views. Best
        rule of thumb is to not set/change any value in a control unless it
        has really changed. Doing so causes the RECT to become invalidated
        which causes the OS to want to repaint it. Data processing is always
        faster than repainting.

        steps later, you really only need to add or delete the difference
        since the last update.
    - MGR: Avoid using 'wxString("Some static Text", wxConvUTF8)' to handle
        literal strings for Unicode, the wxT() macro allows the compiler to
        take care of it at compile time, instead of run-time.

            been assimilated or is overdue
            (i.e. there's a chance of not getting credit)
            send <result_abort_if_not_started>
    - Scheduler: enhancements to replication policy
        (which attempts to send additional replicas of a WU
        only to reliable/fast hosts).
        There are several new config options which let projects
        tailor the policy in various ways:
        - <reliable_min_avg_credit>: a host must have at least
            this avg credit to be considered reliable
        - <reliable_max_avg_turnaround>: a host must have at most
            this avg_turnaround to be considered reliable
        - <reliable_on_priority>: results with at least 
            this priority will be sent only to reliable hosts
        - <reliable_priority_on_over>:
            increase priority of additional replicas by this amount
        - <reliable_priority_on_over_except_error>
            increase priority of additional replicas
            triggered by timeout (but not error) by this amount
        - <reliable_time>: send results for WUs at least this old
            only to reliable hosts
        - <reliable_reduced_delay_bound>: if a WU is at least
            "reliable_time" old, multiply its latency bound
            by this factor (0..1)
    - Transitioner: add the notion of "grace period"
        so users get credit even if results are somewhat late.
        - <grace_period_hours>: defer the deletion of
            the canonical result for this many hours
            after the deadline of any pending result
    - Transitioner: add option <delete_delay_hours>:
        delay the deletion of WU input files for this
        interval after last result has been returned

    Implementation details::
    - add TRANSITIONER_ITEM::res_received_time
    - add WORK_ITEM::res_priority
        (read by feeder, stored in shared mem, used by scheduler)
    - add IN_PROGRESS_RESULT to enumerate in-progress results
    - read appid in VALIDATOR_ITEM
    - add priority_increase arg to create_result()

    (all the above from Kevin Reed)

    - core client: fix bug where, if client runs at boot time
        and DNS system isn't up yet,
        entries in remote_hosts.cfg will fail to resolve,
        and the core client will be inaccessible.
        Fix: we already have a mechanism in which GUI_RPC_CONN_SET::init()
        is called 30 times, at 1-sec interval, until it succeeds.
        Extend this to cover the parsing of remote_hosts.cfg also.

    - Mac: fix Mac Stuffit file corrupted in switch from CVS to Subversion.
    - Mac: Update backtrace to use entirely new code from Apple Developer 
        Technical Support.  The format is now compatible with OS X's 
        built-in Crash Reporter, and is ready for 64-bit Mac Intel 
        applications (which will be available in OS 10.5).  If the backtrace 
        is from a stripped application, the output of this new code can be 
        run through a new shell script (available on Apple's web site) to 
        add symbols to it from a separate symbol file - this is a very useful 
        feature.  For details, see comments in mac_backtrace.h.
        
        Note: We build the PowerPC applications with GCC-3.3 to be backward 
        compatible with OS 10.3.0 - 10.3.8, and GCC 3.3 does not support 
        64-bit applications, and Apple discontinued production of PowerPC 
        Macs in 2006, so this backtrace code does not support 64-bit PowerPC 
        G5 applications.

      project-specific workunit id so that a user's contribution
      can be tied to the appropriate workunit ID in the science
      database (a different ID than in the BOINC database). This logic
      is only enacted with -update_wuhash flag on command line.

      in the workunit.opaque field.

    - Core client: handle multiple platforms correctly.
        Remove the tacet assumption that a host can handle
        applications for a single platform.
        With the Apr 30 scheduler changes,
        a project may (at different times)
        send app versions for the same app and version number,
        but different platforms.
        Before we would have ignored all but the first;
        now we handle them correctly.

        Implementation notes:
        - Add APP_VERSION.platform, RESULT.platform,
            and RESULT.version_num.
            If these are missing from an XML doc
            (e.g. an existing state file or a scheduler reply
            from a project not running current server)
            then set to the primary platform.
        - Continue to write workunit.version_num
            and active_task.version_num to state file,
            even though these are no longer part of the struct.
            This allows users to revert to an older version.

    - scheduler: in send_result_abort(), distinguish between
        the enumeration ending versus it failing.
        This fixes a bug where lots of results would be
        incorrectly aborted if there's a database problem.
        This fix only matters if you use the <send_result_abort> config flag.

    - A better fix for Mac PieCtrl legend clipping bug: wxPieCtrl::Refresh() 
        calls new wxPieCtrlLegend::MeasureText() method to caclulate size of 
        the legend area and SetSize() of legend window before OnPaint() is 
        called.  Apparently, calling SetSize() from within the OnPaint() 
        function doesn't adjust the "invalid" area to be repainted until 
        a return to the event loop, so the added area didn't get painted 
        until the next OnPaint() call.  Also, the wxMemoryDC bitmap was 
        being created at the smaller size, so that was also clipping the 
        drawing.

    - scheduler: add <workload_sim> config option.
        If set, the scheduler will use EDF simulation,
        together with the in-progress workload reported by the client,
        to avoid sending results that
        1) will miss their deadline, or
        2) will cause an in-progress result to miss its deadline, or
        3) will make an in-progress result miss its deadline
            by more than is already predicted.
        If this option is not set, or if the client request doesn't
        include a workload description (i.e. the client is old)
        use the existing approach, which assumes there's no workload.
        NOTE: this is experimental.  Production projects should not use it.

    - core client: on attach to project,
        if the initial sched request failed,
        the manager would show "communicating" for 60 sec,
        then time out and show "failed to attach".
        But the project would actually be attached.
        This was due to a logic error,
        but I fixed it in a more fundamental way:
        by considering an attach to be complete immediately,
        without waiting for a successful scheduler RPC.

        This was originally done to ensure that the URL and account key
        were valid.
        But when using the BOINC Manager, we've already verified
        both of these before doing the attach project RPC.

        When using boinc_cmd, you now have to check for messages
        indicating a bad URL or account key.
        I changed things to print these messages on every sched RPC.

        Implementation: the notion of "tentative project" no longer exists.

    - client: fix bug where:
        1) client wakes up from hibernate
        2) one or more network ops start (e.g. because backoff expired)
        3) ops fail because DNS system isn't up yet
        4) connect to reference site fails too
        5) user sees "please create physical connection",
            even though there's been a physical connection the whole time.
        Solution:
        - keep track of "last wakeup time": the last time the
            time of day (measured in poll_slow_events())
            increased by more than 10 times the polling interval.
            This must be either coming out of hibernation,
            or the user resetting the system clock.
        - When a network operation fails, try to contact the reference site
            only if it's more than 30 seconds after the last wakeup time.

            We'd skip the <unrec>, but parse the <name> within it.
            This wrong.
        New: skip the entire unrecognized element
        NOTE: I implemented this in the new parser (XML_PARSER)
        and added it for everything that uses XML_PARSER.
        The old parser still isn't quite right:
        it will skip until the next </unrec>,
        but not necessarily the matching instance of that tag.

                S += X
        it performs real bad if the file is large

    - client: fix two XML parsing bugs:
        1) XML_PARSER::parse_int() and parse_double() wouldn't parse
            <foo></foo>, and in fact would consume the </foo>,
            so that the resulting skip_unexpected()
            would skip the entire rest of the document.

            This was exercised because my checking of 17 Apr
            set the default for work_buf_min_days as "" rather than 0.

        2) XML_PARSER::scan_tag() was removing spaces,
            so <venue name="home"> parsed as venuename="home"
            This actually didn't do any damage.

Charlie 25 June 2007
    CC: Add logic to scheduler, etc. for systems which limit the number 
        of shared memory segments per process and / or system-wide.  
        Mac OS X has default limits of 8 shmem segments per process, 32 
        max system wide.
        - Don't treat failure to allocate & attach to shared memory as a 
            computation error.
        - Destroy shared memory segments associated with all tasks which 
            exit, not just those with a finished file.  This frees up a 
            segment for use by another task.
        - If we run out of shared memory, start a 10 second timer during 
            which don't try to run tasks unless they are already attached 
            to shared memory (suspended tasks left in memory qualify.)
        - If a task is waiting for shared memory to become available, 
            display this in the Manager's tasks pane.
        - Added a new log flag stress_shmem_debug for testing scheduling 
            logic when we run out of shared memory.
        
    QUESTIONS for further development:
        - Note that it is quite easy to run out of shared memory segments if 
            the leave-suspended-tasks-in-memory option is set.  (The shared 
            memory channel must remain active for heartbeats and to tell the 
            task when to resume.)
            - Should we override this option if we run out of shared memory 
                segments?  
            - What about tasks left in RAM because they don't checkpoint?
        - If BOINC crashes, its shared memory is not removed.  In some 
            cases, when BOINC is relaunched it will use the same key and 
            so can re-attach to the orphaned segments, but this won't always 
            happen.  This can cause problems with the system-wide limits.
            We can't mark the segment for removal when we create it, because 
            doing so (by calling shmctl with IPC_RMID) would remove its key 
            so the project application couldn't attach to it.
            But we could do this safely after the first successful response 
            from the project application.  Should we make this change?

    CC: Problem: On Mac OS X and some other systems, shared memory 
        segments remain allocated unless the owner has marked them 
        for destruction with shmctl(id, IPC_RMID, 0), causing shared 
        memory leaks if BOINC crashes or exits suddenly (e.g., due 
        to being called with --exit_after_finish).
        But on Mac OS X and some other systems, this shmctl command 
        also prevents any more processes from attaching.
        Solution: On *nix systems, BOINC marks shared memory segment 
        for destruction as soon as we receive first message or trickle 
        down from the project application, so BOINC has confirmation 
        that the task has attached.  The segment will automatically be 
        destroyed after all attached processes have detached or exit.

    - Einstein@Home specific hack to locality scheduler.
      If deleting a file with name matching pattern h1_XXXX.XX_S5R22
      generate corresponding l1_XXXX.XX_S5R2 pattern and delete it also.
      This is needed because E@H is doing file locality scheduling with
      PAIRS h1_... and l1_... of files. Yuk.  I am not proud of this.

David  3 July 2007
    - Added program sched/sched_driver.C.
        This generates a sequence of scheduler requests,
        with host info taken from a file,
        that you can feed into the scheduler (cgi --batch)
        to simulate things like homogeneous redundancy
    - Added args to XML_PARSER::skip_unexpected() to you can say
        whether to write messages to stderr for unparsed stuff.
        This is set to true if log_flags.unparsed_xml is set (client)
        or if debug_level is 3 (server)
    - removed references to $(LIBRSA) in Makefile.am's

    - Added the bittorrent tracker code
    - Also added a simple file filter that accepts any file present in the
      download directory for tracking (or whatever directory is set to be the
      data directory).
      FileFilter is the class to subclass if you need some kind of special rules
      on which files to allow your tracker to track. (Some projects may want to
      disallow tracking of workunit files while allowing tracking of application 
      files etc.)
      Once the base system has been done there'll be different file filters to
      chose from.

    - scheduler: the "max_wus_in_progress" option only worked if
        "resend_lost_results" option was used also
        (because the count of in-progress results was
        based from the DB query used by resend_lost_results).

        Fix: initialize the count of in-progress results to
        the list provided in the scheduler request.
    - scheduler: add "--mark_jobs_done" flag; if set, all jobs
        sent are marked as done, and their WUs enabled for transition.
        This is used for simulation purposes,
        in conjunction with sched_driver.
    - scheduler: if --batch option is set, don't check RPC seqnos
        (for simulation purposes)

    - Made the top hosts page translation aware
        (which I should have done 2-3 years ago...)
        It now uses the same caching mechanism as the other two top pages.
        Projects applying this update should consider clearing
        their cache directory for immediate effects -
        or just wait a short while and let the cache do its own work.

David  6 July 2007
    - Back end: add a feature for "blackballing" hosts.
        To do this, set host.max_results_day to -1.
        If you do this, scheduler requests from that host
        will get an error message, and will otherwise be ignored
        (no jobs in or out, no trickles).
    - Scheduler: send_message() should be called ONLY if you're
        not going to call handle_request();
        otherwise we'll write two separate replies.
        To fix this, I added a separate function (send_error_message())
        that can be called within handle_request()
        to deal with error situations.
    - Scheduler: moved debug_sched() to main.C
    - Scheduler: moved logic to send "delete file" commands
        out of handle_request() into a separate function,
        send_file_deletes() in sched_locality.C.
        Remove #ifdef EINSTEIN_AT_HOMEs; maybe someday another project
        will use locality scheduling!

    - User web and client: added a new pref "suspend_if_no_recent_input"
        that lets you suspend computation after a specified period of idleness.
        This is necessary to allow some machines to go into low-power mode

        "Do work while computer is in use?" to
        "Suspend work while computer is in use".
        The former is confusing - if you say yes, BOINC may in fact
        NOT do work while the computer is in use,
        due to other factors (time of day, etc.)

    - feeder: created shared mem seg with 0666 rather than 0660.
        In principle 0660 should work (assuming apache belongs to admin group)
        but apparently on some Linux systems it doesn't,
        and the feeder gets "can't attach to shared mem" errors.

        the prefernces affecting network connectivity.

    Sandbox: Create boinc_exec() function for invoking switcher and 
        setprojectgrp utilities instead of calling system(). POSIX 
        requires that if a shell is invoked by a setuid / setgid 
        process, the shell is run using the real UID and GID. This 
        was not enforced by Mac OS 10.4, but will be enforced by 
        OS 10.5. The system() calls invoke the shell, so we must 
        use fork() and execv() instead.

    Begin implementation of using memory-mapped files for shared memory.
    As a temporary measure during development, the new shared memory logic 
    is selected by defining USE_FILE_MAPPED_SHMEM.  Once the conversion is 
    complete, we will use these as guideposts to remove the old logic 
    (using shmget,shmat, shmdt, shmctl, key_t, etc.) and then remove the 
    references to USE_FILE_MAPPED_SHMEM.
    Note: these changes are to the HEAD / trunk only, for version 6.

        a client will keep trying to download it for 2 weeks.
        A download "file not found" is a permanent error, not transient.
        (fixes #383)
        In general, revised and renamed things to clarify the
        distinction between permanent and transient errors.
        Old functions:
            handle_xfer_failure(), try_next_url(), xfer_failed(),

    - API: fix 2 bugs in new compatibility code for handling V5 graphics 
        messages in a V5 app. 
        - Make graphics app's pid static so it is still available when 
            time to "hide" graphics.
        - Kill graphics app when worker app exits; this is needed to work 
            properly with V5 screensaver.

    - client: first pass at fixing a fundamental design flaw:
        there's a single GUI_HTTP object,
        and it works only if used sequentially,
        i.e. an op is started only after the previous one ends.
        This breaks if a GUI RPC triggerse and op while
        a project-list fetch (initiated by the client itself) is in progress.
        Or if two managers are connected at the same time,
        and both do HTTP ops.
        The solution: have a separate GUI_HTTP object for each GUI_RPC_CONN,
        and an additional one for use by the client itself.

        displaying the message to accommodate larger image sizes.  Add code to 
        center images if less then the allowed max size of 450x166
    - Screen Saver (merge from 5.10):  If graphics are not available,
        then rotate through the currently running results
        (it will change every 10 seconds) for display so that all are presented
    - Manager (merge from 5.10): During an auto-attach initiated by
        a project_init.xml file, Mozilla based browsers are
        checking cookies in the domain  (ex: worldcommunitygrid.org) 
        for a project while IE cookies were only being checked for the
        full project dns (www.worldcommunitygrid.org).
        IE has been changed so that it will also check the domain.
        This mechanism is generic and can be used by any project or 
        account manager.
    - Manager (merge from 5.10): During an auto-attach initiated by
        a project_init.xml file, the code to check for the Setup cookie
        within an IE browser would fail and cause 
        the attach to project dialogue to close with no warning
        in the event that there 
        is a cookie set for the project but there is not a Setup cookie.

    Bittorrent:
    - Changed the torrent generator behaviour from trying only the exact path
      to the file given to trying all paths given by removing the root of the
      path in each step. This enables lookups like:
      ?file=http://someplace.org/yadayada/somepath/real_path_starts_here/file
      where it will then also find the file in 'real_path_starts_here'.
      This makes it easier for the core client Bittorrent code to lookup
      the metadata for a given file when it only knows the URL to that file.
    - Added SQL peer table. This table contains active peers from the tracker.

    - API: get rid of getrusage_mutex to synchronize calls to getrusage()
        and access to worker_thread_ru.
        This was being used in the worker signal handler,
        which is bad because pthread_mutex_lock() can allocate memory.
        I don't think this matters; at worst we might get
        CPU times off by < 1 sec.

    - API, Unix: call getrusage() from the timer thread,

        There's no reason to call it from the signal handler -
        it returns the CPU for the entire process, not the calling thread.
        And it may be asynch-signal-handler-unsafe.
    - API: comment out checks for bad CPU times.
        I don't think this is needed now, and in some cases it's wrong
        (multi-threaded apps can accumulate CPU faster than real time)

    - assimilator: there was a bug in the situation where:
        1) a WU is marked as ready for assimilation and has no errors;
        2) it has no canonical result
        In this case, the assimilate handler gets called anyway,
        typically with the canonical result of the previous WU as arg.
        Note: this situation doesn't arise normally;
        it might happen if some results are deleted accidentally.
        The fix: 
        - identify this situation, and set the WU.error_mask to a new code
            (WU_ERROR_NO_CANONICAL_RESULT)
        - zero out the "canonical_result" variable passed to the handler,
            so even if the handler fails to check wu.error_mask,
            at least it won't assimilate the same result twice.
        Thanks to Hendrik Verhoek for finding this bug.

    - user web: added new framework for DB access from PHP.
        Here's how things should eventually be:
        - inc/db_conn.inc defines DbConn, a PHP class representing
            a connection to a database with
            various generic operations (update, insert etc.).
            DbConn prepends the DB name to table names,
            so you don't have to select a DB;
            this means you can access multiple databases
            (e.g. BOINC and Bossa) and use persistent connections.
            ALL MYSQL-SPECIFIC CODE WILL EVENTUALLY BE HERE.
        - inc/boinc_db.inc defines classes BoincUser, BoincTeam etc.,
            representing the various BOINC DB tables.
            All access to the DB should use these classes.

        When you use this framework, no initialization calls are needed.
        db.inc is deprecated and should eventually be removed.

        I changed get_logged_in_user()
        and all team-related code to use this framework.
    - user web: show team founder link to "management functions"
        even if they're not currently a member;
        allow team founder to perform all operations even if not a member.
    - turned on E_ALL error checking,
        and fixed a bunch of warnings
        and a couple of bugs ($team, not team)

    - Mac: Fix bugs in scripts for building wxMac-2.6.3; fix XCode project 
        when using debug build of wxMac-2.6.3; Use gcc-4.0 compiler to 
        build wxMac-2.6.3 and curl_7.17.0 for use in BOINC Client and Manager. 
    - Mac: buildcurl.sh accepts optional argument -gcc33 to use gcc-3.3 for 
        PowerPC build so it can be linked with BOINC libraries when building 
        backward-compatible project science applications.

    - API: when creating message strings for CPU time etc.,

        Einstein@home has seen some SEGVs in this function.
        I suspect that it's getting 1e304-type values
        (why? possible bugs in getrusage-related code, still)

    - client: fix bug where account settings (e.g. don't get new work)
        weren't being updated from account managers.
        This was because BAM! wasn't returning the <authenticator>
        in accounts already described in the request message.
        (This violates the protocol, but it's reasonable so what the heck).
        The client was ignoring all <account> records without an authenticator.
        Solution: allow <account> records without an authenticator.

        for a no-longer-running result.

        is shutting down, and when the desktop heap is fully utilized.

        e.g. to make large queries more efficient.
        Also added BoincTeam::lookup_id_cache(); this is an example
        of how to look up items likely to be repeated

    - user web: enhancements to the "foundership request" feature:
        - If a request is pending, notify the current founder
            in red on their Account page.
            (previously there was no notification on the web;
            if the founder didn't get the notification email,
            they'd never find out; and if they read but lost the email,
            they'd lose the URL they needed to visit to decline).
        - Also notify current founder on the Admin Functions page
        - On the team page
            requesting user: show that request is pending, and the deadline.
            founder: show that request is pending, link to respond
            other users: show Deferred if can't make a request yet
        - Say 90 days instead of 60 days where appropriate;
            other text cleanup
    - user web: team_change_founder_action.php was generating
        a different name for each element of a radio button group.

    - added features to pass_percentage_per_platform:

      1. distinguish between Darwin x86 and Darwin PPC
      2. lists the "fail rates" for individual client states to allow to
         distinguish between download errors, computing errors and aborts
      3. optionally list individual "unknown" OS by name
      4. optionally list "unofficial" application versions
      3. and 4. are probably rather confusing on open-source projects like SETI,
      but I found them helpful e.g. on Einstein

    - API: switch back to structure where the worker thread
        calls getrusage() in a signal handler to find its CPU time.
        Apparently there are some kernels and/or thread libraries
        where getrusage() does NOT return the total CPU time of
        all threads in the process,
        so in these cases calling it from the timer thread doesn't work.
        
        This was originally changed because of concerns that
        calling getrusage() in a signal handler was dangerous;
        we'll see if any problems re-emerge.

        The alternative of reading /proc/PID/stats doesn't seem viable;

    - make_project: don't create symbolic link html/user_profiles/user_profiles.
        If there was ever a need for this, it has disappeared.

    - web: don't require login for show_user.php
    - web: add app selection to example project-specific prefs

    - client: add --start_delay cmdline option and <start_delay> config option.
        Specifies an amount of time to delay starting apps
        (e.g. so that BOINC doesn't slow down boot process)

        Note: mechanisms that start BOINC at boot time
        need to figure out how to set this flag.

    - web: add general-purpose notification mechanism.
        Users can choose whether to get 1 email per notification,
        a daily "digest" email, or no email.
        (All notifications are shown on the Account page).
        Currently used for:
        - Friend requests and confirmations
        - Posts to subscribed threads
        - Private messages

        NOTE: To implement the "daily digest" feature, projects must add
        a periodic task for html/ops/notify.php to config.xml
    - web: have project_footer() generate links for
        Account Page and Message Boards as well as Home
        NOTE: projects that want this change
        will have to modify their own project.inc.

    - Partly fix keyboard detection on Linux.
        With this change, we detect opening a terminal
        or typing into a terminal;
        we don't detect typing into other applications.
        (from Frank Thomas).  Partly fixes #463
