Packages required for running the server:

  mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient

  apache, apache2, apache-ssl
  php4-cgi (or php4 if running apache 1)

  python-mysqldb, python-xml

Packages required for compilation:

  g++

  libgl-dev libglu-dev
    (these are virtual packages; one example of packages that provide these are:
       mesag-dev xlibmesa-glu-dev
    )

  libmysqlclient-dev

  libglutg3 libglut3-dev
 
  libgtk2.0 libgtk2.0-dev

  libwxgtk2.2 libwxgtk2.2-dev
    (Note: after installing these packages, you will still need to
     download/compile/install a newer version. Make sure you end up
     with a libwx_gtk-2.4.a as well as libwx_gtk-2.4.so. You'll need
     to configure with the --disable-shared option to get the .a).
    (Another Note: Depending on what gtk packages you have installed,
     you may be missing the script "gtk-config" which wxwidgets needs
     to configure (it uses the script to determine gtk version. At worst,
     just make a script called gtk-config that spits out the version
     number of GTK when called with the "--version" command line option,
     i.e.:
             # gtk-config --version
             1.2.10
    ).

Packages required if you change makefiles:

  autoconf (>= 2.59)
  automake (>= 1.9.3)
    (both are very easy to download from gnu and compile/install)
