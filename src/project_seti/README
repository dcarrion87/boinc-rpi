NAME
    seti_boinc - the SETI@home client program

SYNOPSIS
    seti_boinc [options]

DESCRIPTION
    seti_boinc is the boinc version of the SETI@home client.
    It runs under the BOINC client which downloads radio telescope data 
    from a network server, analyzes the data looking for signals of 
    extraterrestrial origin, and uploads results to the server, 
    repeating this cycle indefinitely.  
    See http://setiathome.berkeley.edu for more information.

FILES
    In order to use seti_boinc to analyze data from the seti@home project
    you must first download the BOINC client software which is avalable
    through the setiathome web page http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/
    If used on a supported host platform, the BOINC client will automatically
    download the most recent versions of the seti@home client software.

    If you are compiling for an unsupported host platform, you may need to use
    the boinc anonymous platform mechanism described at
    http://boinc.berkeley.edu/anonymous_platform.php

    The program generates several files with .sah extension
    in the directory from which it's run.
    These should not be modified.
