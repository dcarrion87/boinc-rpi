This is the seti_boinc ops/bin directory. Here you will find all kinds
of script/binary tools for day-to-day operations of seti (and other
affiliated projects). If you add anything, please note here where you
expect the actually script to live and run in normal life.

### The following are in ~seti/dr2_data/productions/scripts and are
### used for data_pipeline management. Note that data_flow.cfg is a
### perl "include file" that many of the other scripts read in before
### executing. Maybe that should go elsewhere at some point.
