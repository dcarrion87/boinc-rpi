This document will describe how to install seti with graphics. 

Make sure that boinc has been installed with graphics enabled. Follow
the instructions Makefile.Readme in seti_boinc/client to make sure
that Makefile.in.graphics will work with  your system. Rename
Makefile.in.graphics as Makefile.in. From the seti_boinc/ directory
run configure (or ./configure), then make. The executable will then be
xseti[version and system info] and your app_info.xml file should
reflect that name.
